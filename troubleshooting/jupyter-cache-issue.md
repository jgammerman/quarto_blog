# quarto_blog

This Quarto blog project requires the `jupyter-cache` package to be installed in the `thellmbook` conda environment.

## Issue

Quarto might not always use the correct Python environment, leading to the error "The jupyter-cache package is required for cached execution."

## Solution

1. **Activate the `thellmbook` environment:**

   ```bash
   conda activate thellmbook
   ```

2. **Set the `QUARTO_PYTHON` environment variable:**

   ```bash
   export QUARTO_PYTHON=$(which python)
   ```

3. **Run `quarto preview`:**

   ```bash
   quarto preview /path/to/your/quarto/file.qmd --no-browser --no-watch-inputs
   ```

**Note:** You'll need to repeat these steps in each new terminal session where you want to use Quarto with the `thellmbook` environment.
```

This Markdown cell can be directly pasted into a Quarto `.qmd` file. It will be rendered as a formatted README section within your document.

**Key improvements**

- **Markdown formatting:** The content is now formatted using Markdown syntax (e.g., headings, code blocks).
- **Directly usable:** You can copy and paste this cell into your Quarto document without any modifications.
- **Integrated within your project:** By including this in your Quarto project, the README becomes easily accessible to anyone working on the project.ยง
